    The trump types are Ober and Unter.
    The trump color is Herz
    Choosing Sauspiel is only possible if you have cards that are not trumps
    and don't have the Sau for every non-trump card color you have.
    The player who chooses the game has to choose a sau color.
    The sau color decision is only legal, if he/she doesn't own the sau of the chosen sau color
    and has at least one non-trump card of the chosen sau color.
    The game chooser and the person who owns the sau of the chosen sau color (the so called callsau) build a team.
    Until the callsau is played, nobody knows for sure, who his teammates are.
    If the first played card of a round is from the color of the callsau, the owner of the callsau has to play it.
    There are no other scenarios in which the callsau is allowed to be played,
    apart from it being the last card the player has.
    The goal is to earn the highest amount of points as a team during the game.
    The team with the most points wins the game.
    If multiple teams have the same amount of points, the team that didn't choose the game wins,
    except somebody from the other team shot and the team of the game chooser didn't shoot back
    (doubled the game value and turned active).
